# Friends and Family
_This README is the README for this repository and not for the software program Friends and Family. The README for each version of the software is included in the relevant version's folder._

Friends and Family is a Windows program with a graphical user interface (GUI) used to identify unrelated individuals from pairwise relatedness estimates. 

## Summary
This repository contains the files `Friends_and_Family_v22.zip` and `Friends_and_Family_v21.zip` that contain the Windows executable software program Friends and Family, versions 22 and 21, with associated example input and output files and README. The corresponding unzipped folders are also provided, if one wants to download specific individual files only.

The .zip folders also contain the source code in a text file and the file README_Source_Code that goes along with it.

The main difference between the versions is that v22 can handle more datapoints in the input file (1,000,000 in v22 vs 10,000 in v21). See the README for v22 for more detail.
