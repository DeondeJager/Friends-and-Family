# Friends-and-Family
This README is the README for this repository and not for the software program Friends and Family.
This repository contains the files Friends_and_Family_v22.zip and Friends_and_Family_v21.zip that contain the Windows executable software program Friends and Family, versions 22 and 21, with associated example input and output files and README. The .zip folders also contain the source code in a text file and the file README_Source_Code that goes along with it.

The main difference between the versions is that v22 can handle more datapoints in the input file (1 000 000 in v22 vs 10 000 in v21). See the README for v22 for more detail.

To download Friends and Family, click on the link above and then on the "Download" button to the right of the screen.
